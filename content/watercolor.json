        "Developed a real-time watercolor simulation with pigment flow effects in C++.",
        "I attempted to implement the SIGGRAPH 1997 paper [*Computer-Generated Watercolor*](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/watercolor/paper_small.pdf) by Curtis et al. I was able to partially implement 5/6 of the techniques described in the paper: edge darkening, backruns, granulation, wet-on-wet flow effects, and color glazing.",
        "Designed a custom staggered grid data structure. Used forward Euler integration to simulate wet pigment flow and the adsorption/desorption mechanics of watercolor pigment on paper.",
        "Final project for CPSC 679 at Yale, *Physics Simulation for Movies and Games*.",
